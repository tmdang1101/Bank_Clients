# Identifying Bank Clients

I applied various machine learning models on a bank telemarketing dataset. The goal was to determine if someone is a potential client for the bank. The classification models used were Logistic Regression, K-NN, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. I compared their effectiveness by looking at confusion matrices and their accuracy in percentages. Along the way, I also needed to modify the data so they would work on these models.
